\begin{abstract}
Certain patents are historically important or relevant.  We present several
metrics based on network structure to classify or rank the importance of
patents in a citation network.  These metrics can be evaluated by checking
their output against known significant patents. We can then rerun good metrics
on larger sets of patents to discover trends about significant patents.

In this paper, we perform a case study on a set of LED-related patents to
discover if certain authors, companies, or locations correlate with patent
success.
