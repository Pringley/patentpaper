Abstract
========

-   certain patents are historically relevant

-   find metrics that match consensus for top few

-   extend metrics to entire dataset to find correlations that indicate
    success/influence of a patent

Outline
=======

1.  Background on LEDs (important innovations, patents, etc)

    - describe what our "expected results" are for top patents

2.  Techniques

    - prior art in citation networks

    - baseline: # of forward citations (outdegree)

    - existing techniques: hits, pagerank

    - new techniques: neighborrank, feature classifier

    - which match the historical background best?

3.  Extended Analysis

    - run best techniques on entire dataset

    - look for correlations with company size, age, location, etc

4.  Conclusions

    - do key innovations come from big or small companies?

    - are innovations geographically clustered? temporally?
